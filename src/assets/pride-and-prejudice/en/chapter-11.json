But it has been the study of my life to avoid those weaknesses which often expose a strong understanding to ridicule.\" \"Such as vanity and pride.\" \"Yes, vanity is a weakness indeed. But pride—where there is a real superiority of mind, pride will be always under good regulation.\" Elizabeth turned away to hide a smile. \"Your examination of Mr. Darcy is over, I presume,\" said Miss Bingley; \"and pray what is the result?\" \"I am perfectly convinced by it that Mr. Darcy has no defect."
