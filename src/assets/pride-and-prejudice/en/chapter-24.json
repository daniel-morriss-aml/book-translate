    },
    {
      "index": 52,
      "sentence": "They may wish many things besides his happiness; they may wish his increase of wealth and consequence; they may wish him to marry a girl who has all the importance of money, great connections, and pride.\" \"Beyond a doubt, they do wish him to choose Miss Darcy,\" replied Jane; \"but this may be from better feelings than you are supposing."

    },
    {
      "index": 56,
      "sentence": "If they believed him attached to me, they would not try to part us; if he were so, they could not succeed. By supposing such an affection, you make everybody acting unnaturally and wrong, and me most unhappy."
    },
    {
      "index": 57,
      "sentence": "Do not distress me by the idea. I am not ashamed of having been mistakenâ€” or, at least, it is light, it is nothing in comparison of what I should feel in thinking ill of him or his sisters."
    },
    {
      "index": 58,
      "sentence": "Let me take it in the best light, in the light in which it may be understood.\" Elizabeth could not oppose such a wish; and from this time Mr. Bingley's name was scarcely ever mentioned between them. Mrs. Bennet still continued to wonder and repine at his returning no more, and though a day seldom passed in which Elizabeth did not account for it clearly, there was little chance of her ever considering it with less perplexity."
    },

      "index": 59,
      "sentence": "Her daughter endeavoured to convince her of what she did not believe herself, that his attentions to Jane had been merely the effect of a common and transient liking, which ceased when he saw her no more; but though the probability of the statement was admitted at the time, she had the same story to repeat every day.

      "sentence": "We must not all expect Jane's good fortune.\" \"True,\" said Mr. Bennet, \"but it is a comfort to think that whatever of that kind may befall you, you have an affectionate mother who will make the most of it.\" Mr. Wickham's society was of material service in dispelling the gloom which the late perverse occurrences had thrown on many of the Longbourn family."

      "index": 69,
      "sentence": "They saw him often, and to his other recommendations was now added that of general unreserve."
