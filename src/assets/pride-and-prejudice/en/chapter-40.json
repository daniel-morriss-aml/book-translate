      "sentence": "She dared not relate the other half of Mr. Darcy's letter, nor explain to her sister how sincerely she had been valued by her friend.

      "index": 40,
      "sentence": "Having never even fancied herself in love before, her regard had all the warmth of first attachment, and, from her age and disposition, greater steadiness than most first attachments often boast; and so fervently did she value his remembrance, and prefer him to every other man, that all her good sense, and all her attention to the feelings of her friends, were requisite to check the indulgence of those regrets which must have been injurious to her own health and their tranquillity. \"Well, Lizzy,\" said Mrs. Bennet one day, \"what is your opinion now of this sad business of Jane's? For my part, I am determined never to speak of it again to anybody."
