You are formatting bilingual book data for my reading app.

Task: Convert the two raw texts I provide (German = target, English = native) into a single JSON object with this exact schema:

{
  "id": "pap-de-en-",
  "title": "Pride and Prejudice / Stolz und Vorurteil - Chapter ",
  "targetLanguage": "German",
  "nativeLanguage": "English",
  "pages": [
    { "pageNumber": 1, "sentences": [ { "target": "", "native": "" }, ... 8 items ] },
    { "pageNumber": 2, "sentences": [ ... 8 items ] }
  ]
}

Rules:

Align sentence-by-sentence (target ↔︎ native). Do not translate or invent text.

Paginate to 8 sentences per page. If the last page has fewer than 8 it can be shorter.

Preserve punctuation, quotes, and diacritics.

Keep all text as supplied, including all backslash (\) characters.

Keep languages as given (no swapping).

Do not include any commentary—output JSON only.
